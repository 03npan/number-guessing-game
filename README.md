# number-guessing-game
This is a basic number guessing game I did as a project a while back.
Right now it allows for the user to select the range in which the random number will be chosen. It will create the random number in the range and will let the user know if they guessed higher or lower than that number. The program will also record the previous guesses for the user to refer to. Once the user guesses the correct number, they will be asked if they want to play again. If so, the program will repeat itself, but if not, it will end the program.
Feel free to contribute to this and make it better (my very basic knowledge of Python limits what I can do).
